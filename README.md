Notices:
Tested and run on android emulator.
Saved members images to an asset folder and used as constants.
In config file, for android I am using a default ip the emulator gives because localhost wouldnt work. For ios, localhost should work, but didnt test it to be honest.
I think add member button is just fine there. Very neat. Another usage could be top right corner.

Improvements:
Improve graphql usage.
Figma designs can have a little bit more consistency.
Improve relative pathing with babel.
Improve usage of graphql for emulators. (Maybe add express listener for hitting graphql so as to export server for specific machine ip, instead of just localhost)
